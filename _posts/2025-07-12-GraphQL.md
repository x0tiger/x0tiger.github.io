## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook to solve problems developers faced with REST APIs. Instead of calling multiple endpoints to get related data, you send a single, structured request that returns just what you need — no more, no less.

Unlike REST, where the server defines the response structure, GraphQL gives control to the client. This makes it powerful, flexible, and highly customizable — but also introduces several security risks if not implemented carefully.

---

## How GraphQL Works (Behind the Scenes)

When a client sends a GraphQL request, here’s what typically happens:

1. **Parsing** – The server parses the incoming query string.
    
2. **Validation** – It validates the query against the defined schema.
    
3. **Execution** – Resolvers are triggered for each field in the query.
    
4. **Response** – A structured JSON response is returned to the client.
    

GraphQL queries are usually sent via HTTP POST requests to a single endpoint, like `/graphql`, with a body like:

```json
{
  "query": "query { user(id: 1) { name email } }"
}
```

The response is:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "x0tiger",
      "email": "x0tiger@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Core Components of GraphQL

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Schema**|Defines the types, fields, and operations allowed in the API.|
|**Query**|For retrieving data (read operations).|
|**Mutation**|For modifying data (create, update, delete).|
|**Subscription**|For real-time updates using WebSockets.|
|**Resolver**|The function behind each field that actually fetches the data.|

Example Schema:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

## Real-World Usage of GraphQL

In large frontend applications (e.g. SPAs or mobile apps), GraphQL significantly improves performance and developer experience by:

- Reducing the number of requests.
    
- Preventing over-fetching or under-fetching data.
    
- Allowing clients to evolve independently from the backend.
    

Example: A dashboard view on a mobile app might need only a few fields.

```graphql
query {
  currentUser {
    name
    profilePicture(size: SMALL)
    unreadMessages
  }
}
```

---

## Features and Usage Patterns

### Fragments

Used to avoid repeating field definitions.

```graphql
fragment userFields on User {
  id
  name
  email
}
```

Then used like:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 5) {
    ...userFields
  }
}
```

---

### Aliases

Allow sending multiple queries with the same field name.

```graphql
query {
  firstUser: user(id: 1) { name }
  secondUser: user(id: 2) { name }
}
```

---

### Variables

Allow dynamic queries without rebuilding the query string.

```json
{
  "query": "query getUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }",
  "variables": { "id": "1" }
}
```

---

### Directives

Modify execution logic (e.g. conditionally including a field).

```graphql
query getUser($showEmail: Boolean!) {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email @include(if: $showEmail)
  }
}
```

## Security Risks in GraphQL APIs

Although GraphQL appears secure due to its strict schema and typed system, in practice many APIs expose dangerous behavior due to misconfiguration or weak controls.

### Common Vulnerabilities

|Risk|Description|
|---|---|
|**Exposed Introspection**|Allows full schema discovery (`__schema`, `__type`).|
|**Broken Access Control**|Lack of per-resolver permission checks.|
|**No Rate Limiting**|Abuse via batching, aliases, deep nesting.|
|**Lack of Depth/Complexity Limits**|Enables DoS via recursive queries.|
|**Injection Attacks**|SQL/NoSQL injections inside query filters.|
|**CSRF with Cookies**|When CORS is open and cookies are used for auth.|
|**Exposed Mutations**|Unprotected create/update/delete operations.|
|**Excessive Error Disclosure**|Leaks schema or stack traces.|

---

## Attack Scenarios and Testing Techniques

Below are common GraphQL attack cases you can test against:

### Introspection Enabled

**Goal**: Discover schema details  
**Payload**:

```graphql
{ __schema { types { name fields { name } } } }
```

---

### Authorization Bypass

**Goal**: Access restricted fields  
**Payload**:

```graphql
query { adminPanel { secretToken } }
```

---

### SQL Injection in Filters

**Goal**: Inject malicious query logic  
**Payload**:

```graphql
query {
  users(where: { name: { _eq: "' OR 1=1 --" } }) {
    id
  }
}
```

---

### Deep Recursion (Denial of Service)

**Goal**: Crash the server or spike CPU  
**Payload**:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    posts {
      comments {
        user {
          posts {
            comments {
              user {
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Batch Queries (Mass Enumeration)

**Goal**: Enumerate data via batching  
**Payload**:

```graphql
query {
  u1: user(id: 1) { email }
  u2: user(id: 2) { email }
  u3: user(id: 3) { email }
}
```

---

### SSRF via Resolver

**Goal**: Fetch internal URLs via exposed resolver  
**Payload**:

```graphql
query {
  fetchUrl(url: "http://localhost:8000/internal")
}
```

---

### GraphQL Injection via Variables

**Goal**: Manipulate query structure indirectly  
**Payload**:

```json
{
  "query": "query getUser($field: String!) { user { $field } }",
  "variables": {
    "field": "password"
  }
}
```

## Tools for Testing and Securing GraphQL

| Tool                | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **GraphQLmap**      | CLI for automating attacks and fuzzing |
| **InQL**            | Burp Suite plugin for GraphQL testing  |
| **Altair**          | GUI client for crafting queries        |
| **GraphCrawler**    | Schema/path exploration & brute force  |
| **GraphQL Voyager** | Visualizes GraphQL schemas             |

## Recommendations for Securing GraphQL APIs

- **Disable introspection** in production.
    
- **Limit query depth** and total complexity.
    
- **Validate inputs** strictly — don’t rely only on GraphQL types.
    
- **Enforce per-resolver authorization**.
    
- **Log and monitor** query patterns.
    
- **Throttle and rate-limit** requests.
    
- **Block unused or dangerous mutations**.
    

---

## Summary

GraphQL is a flexible, efficient, and modern way to build APIs. However, its dynamic nature and client-driven queries introduce unique security challenges that differ from REST.

To secure GraphQL:

- Know your schema.
    
- Control access at the resolver level.
    
- Limit what clients can do — not just what they can see.
    
- And always test, monitor, and review.
    

When done right, GraphQL boosts productivity. When done wrong, it can expose your entire backend.
